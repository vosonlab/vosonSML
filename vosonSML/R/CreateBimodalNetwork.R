#' Create bimodal networks from social media data
#'
#' This function creates a bimodal network from social media data (i.e. from data frames of class \code{dataSource}, or 
#' for Twitter data it is also possible to provide a *list* of data frames), with edges representing relationships 
#' between actors of two different types (e.g. Facebook users and Facebook posts, with edges representing whether a 
#' user has commented or 'liked' a post).
#'
#' This function creates a (directed and weighted) bimodal network from a data frame of class \code{dataSource} (which 
#' are created using the 'CollectData' family of functions in the vosonSML package), or a *list* of Twitter data 
#' frames collected using \code{CollectDataTwitter} function.
#'
#' The resulting network is an igraph graph object. This graph object is bimodal because edges represent relationships 
#' between vertices of two different types. For example, in a bimodal Facebook network, vertices represent Facebook 
#' users or Facebook posts, and edges represent whether a user has commented or 'liked' a post. Edges are directed and 
#' weighted (e.g. if user i has commented n times on post j, then the weight of this directed edge equals n).
#'
#' @param x A data frame of class \code{dataSource}. For Twitter data, it is also possible to provide a *list* of data 
#' frames (i.e. data frames that inherit class \code{dataSource} and \code{twitter}). Only lists of Twitter data 
#' frames are supported at this time. If a list of data frames is provided, then the function binds these row-wise and 
#' computes over the entire data set.
#' @param writeToFile Logical. If \code{TRUE} then the network is saved to file in current working directory (GRAPHML 
#' format), with filename denoting the current date/time and the type of network.
#' @param removeTermsOrHashtags Character string. Default is none. Otherwise this argument specifies which terms or 
#' hashtags (i.e. vertices with matching 'name') should be removed from the bimodal network. This is useful to remove
#' the search term or hashtag that was used to collect the data (i.e. remove the corresponding vertex in the graph). 
#' For example, a value of "#auspol" means that if there is a vertex with the exact name "#auspol" then this vertex 
#' will be removed.
#' @param ... Additional parameters to pass to the network creation method.
#' 
#' @return An igraph graph object, with weighted and directed edges.
#' 
#' @note Supported data sources: \code{facebook}, \code{twitter}
#'
#' For Twitter data, bimodal networks can be created from multiple data frames (i.e. datasets collected individually 
#' using CollectDataTwitter). Simply create a list of the data frames that you wish to create a network from. For
#' example, \code{myList <- list(myTwitterData1, myTwitterData2, myTwitterData3)}.

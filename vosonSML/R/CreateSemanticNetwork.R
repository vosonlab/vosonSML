#' Creates a semantic network from social media data (semantic relationships between concepts)
#'
#' This function creates a semantic network from social media data (i.e. from data frames of class \code{dataSource}, 
#' or for Twitter data it is also possible to provide a list of data frames). In such semantic networks, concepts are 
#' words/terms extracted from the text corpus of social media data (e.g. tweets on Twitter).
#'
#' This function creates a weighted network from a data frame of class \code{dataSource} (which are created using the 
#' 'CollectData' family of functions in the vosonSML package), or a list of Twitter data frames collected using 
#' \code{CollectDataTwitter} function.
#'
#' The resulting semantic network is an igraph graph object. This graph object is semantic because vertices represent 
#' unique concepts (in this case unique terms/words extracted from a social media text corpus), and edges represent 
#' the co-occurrence of terms for all observations in the data set. For example, for a Twitter semantic network, 
#' vertices represent either hashtags (e.g. "#auspol") or single terms ("politics"). If there are 1500 tweets in the 
#' data set (i.e. 1500 observations), and the term "#auspol" and the term "politics" appear together in every tweet, 
#' then this will be represented by an edge with weight equal to 1500.
#'
#' @param x A data frame of class \code{dataSource}. For Twitter data, it is also possible to provide a *list* of data 
#' frames (i.e. data frames that inherit class \code{dataSource} and \code{twitter}). Only lists of Twitter data 
#' frames are supported at this time. If a list of data frames is provided, then the function binds these row-wise and 
#' computes over the entire data set.
#' @param writeToFile Logical. If \code{TRUE} then the network is saved to file in current working directory (GRAPHML 
#' format), with filename denoting the current date/time and the type of network.
#' @param termFreq Numeric integer. Specifies the percentage of most frequent TERMS to include. For example, a value 
#' of 20 means that the 20 percent most frequently occurring terms will be included in the semantic network. The 
#' default value is 5, meaning the 5 percent most frequent terms are used.
#' @param hashtagFreq ** NOT IMPLEMENTED YET - DEFAULTS TO ALL HASHTAGS **.
#' Numeric integer. Specifies the percentage of most frequent HASHTAGS to include. For example, a value of 80 means 
#' that the 80 percent most frequently occurring hashtags will be included in the semantic network. The default value 
#' is 50, meaning the 50 percent most frequent hashtags are used.
#' @param removeTermsOrHashtags Character string vector. Default is none. Otherwise this argument specifies which terms 
#' or hashtags (i.e. vertices with matching 'name') should be removed from the semantic network. This is useful to 
#' remove the search term or hashtag that was used to collect the data (i.e. remove the corresponding vertex in the 
#' graph). For example, a value of "#auspol" means that if there is a vertex with the name "#auspol" then this vertex 
#' will be removed.
#' @param stopwordsEnglish Logical. If \code{TRUE} then English stopwords are removed from the tweets (e.g. words such 
#' as 'the' or 'and'). Using \code{FALSE} may be helpful non-English data sets. The default is \code{TRUE} (i.e. 
#' stopwords will be removed).
#' @param ... Additional parameters to pass to the network creation method.
#' 
#' @return An igraph graph object, with weighted edges.
#' 
#' @note Currently supported data sources:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \code{twitter}
#' }
#'
#' For Twitter data, semantic networks can be created from multiple data frames (i.e. datasets collected individually 
#' using CollectDataTwitter). Simply create a list of the data frames that you wish to create a network from. For
#' example, \code{myList <- list(myTwitterData1, myTwitterData2, myTwitterData3)}.

  # OK, now extract only the UNIQUE pairs (i.e. rows)
  # But, also create a WEIGHT value for multiple mentions between users
  
  # NOTE: This edge weights approach might be problematic for TEMPORAL actor networks, because each edge 
  # (with weight > 1) represents mentions in tweets at DIFFERENT TIMES.
  
  # NOTE: A possible workaround could be to include an edge attribute that is a set of timestamp elements, showing 
  # the date/time of each unique 'mention'.
  
  # NOTE: For example, in a temporal visualisation, the first timestamp might 'pop in' the edge to the graph, which
  # then might start to 'fade out' over time (or just 'pop out' of graph after N seconds) if there are no more 
  # timestamps indicating activity (i.e. mentions) between the two users.
  
  # NOTE: So, a 'timestamps' edge attribute could factor into a kind of 'entropy' based approach to evolving the 
  # network visually over time.

  # unique pairs:
  # unique_dfActorNetwork1 <- unique(dfActorNetwork1)
  # unique_dfActorNetwork1 <- dfActorNetwork1 # DEBUG - DO WE EVEN WANT UNIQUE PAIRS?

CreateActorNetwork(x, ...)

\method{CreateActorNetwork}{default}(x, ...)

\method{CreateActorNetwork}{reddit}(x, weightEdges = FALSE,
  textData = FALSE, cleanText = TRUE, writeToFile = FALSE, ...)

\method{CreateActorNetwork}{twitter}(x, writeToFile = FALSE,

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Collected social media data with \code{social media} class attribute.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters to pass to the network creation method.}

\item{weightEdges}{Logical. Combines and weights directed network edges. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{textData}{Logical. If the igraph network should include the comment text as an edge attribute. 
Cannot be used with the \code{weightEdges} parameter. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{cleanText}{Logical. If non-alphanumeric, non-punctuation, and non-space characters should be removed from the 
included text attribute data. Only applies if \code{textData = TRUE}. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{writeToFile}{Logical. Save network data to a file in the current working directory. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Output additional information about the network creation. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A reddit actor network as igraph object.

A twitter actor network as list containing a relations dataframe, users dataframe and igraph object.

A youtube actor network as igraph object.
}
\description{
This function creates an actor network from social media data collected using the \code{Collect} method. Edges in 
the network represent interactions or relationships between the actors. For example, with twitter data an 
interaction is defined as a 'mention', reply' or 'retweet' from user i to user j, given 'tweet' m. With youtube 
comments, an interaction is defined as a 'reply' from user i to user j, given 'comment' m. The resulting network is 
returned as an igraph object.
}
\note{
For twitter data, actor networks can be created from multiple data frames (i.e. datasets collected individually
using \code{Collect} method. Simply create a list of the data frames that you wish to create a network from.
For example, \code{myList <- list(myTwitterData1, myTwitterData2, myTwitterData3)}

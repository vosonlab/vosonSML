\title{Collection and network analysis of social media data}
\description{
The goal of the \pkg{vosonSML} package is to provide a suite of easy-to-use tools for collecting data 
from social media and generating different types of networks suited to Social Network Analysis (SNA) and text 
analytics. It offers tools to create unimodal, multimodal, and semantic networks. Excellent packages such as 
\pkg{rtweet}, \pkg{RedditExtractoR}, \pkg{magrittr}, \pkg{dplyr} and \pkg{igraph} were drawn on to provide an 
integrated work flow for creating different types of networks out of social media data. Creating networks from 
online social media is often non-trivial and time consuming. This package simplifies such tasks so users can focus 
on analysis.

\pkg{vosonSML} uses a straightforward S3 class system. Data collected with this package produces \code{data.frame} 
inheritable objects that are assigned the class \code{"datasource"}. Additionally, \code{"datasource"} objects are 
attributed a class identifying the source of data, such as \code{"twitter"} or \code{"youtube"}. In this way 
\code{datasource} objects are fast, easy to work with, and can be used as input to easily construct different kinds 
of networks. For example, the function \code{Collect} can be used to collect twitter data, which is then passed to 
the \code{Create} function resulting in a twitter network (as igraph object) that is ready for analysis.
